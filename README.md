# Simon-Game
This is a repository containing files and assets of virtual Simon game.

Simon is an electronic game of short-term memory skill invented by Ralph H. Baer and Howard J. Morrison. The game involves the player in remembering a sequence of colours and pressing colours in that sequence, ending the game if the player gets the sequence wrong, otherwise adding one more colour to the sequence in each turn.

This virtual Simon game contains four coloured buttons, that flash on each turn and the player must press it, after they have followed the previous sequence of colors. Clicking a wrong button will end the game.

  * Unique sounds attached to each coloured button to help used identify buttons with audio cue as well.
  * A player score display that shows how far did the player reach. Measured in levels. (difficulty doesn't change upon higher levels)
  * Colorblind Aid Mode: Labels the coloured blocks, as well as provides voiced pronunciation for colours.
